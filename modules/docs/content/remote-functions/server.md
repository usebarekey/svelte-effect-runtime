# Server Runtime

Remote functions always execute their Effect callback on the server. `Query`,
`Command`, `Form`, and `Prerender` all eventually run through the server
runtime.

```ts
import { RequestEvent, ServerRuntime } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
```

This page explains what the server runtime is responsible for, when you need to
configure it, and how it interacts with request-scoped data.

## What the server runtime does

When a remote function executes on the server, `svelte-effect-runtime`:

1. Resolves the current server runtime.
2. Injects SvelteKit's `RequestEvent` into the Effect environment.
3. Runs the remote Effect and converts failures into the correct remote response
   shape.

That means the server runtime is the place where you provide server-side
dependencies such as:

- database pools
- server-only API clients
- loggers
- caches
- configuration and secrets

The callback you pass to `Query(...)`, `Command(...)`, `Form(...)`, or
`Prerender(...)` can then access those services with normal Effect patterns:

```ts
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect";
import { Query } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
import { Database } from "$lib/server/database";

export const get_post = Query(
  Schema.Struct({
    slug: Schema.String,
  }),
  ({ slug }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const db = yield* Database;

      return yield* db.find_post_by_slug(slug);
    }),
);
```

## Default behavior

`ServerRuntime.make(...)` is optional.

If no server runtime has been registered yet, the first remote Effect that runs
will create a default `ManagedRuntime` backed by an empty layer. That is enough
for remote functions that only use plain Effect operators and do not depend on
custom `Context` services.

This works:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { Query } from "svelte-effect-runtime";

export const get_version = Query(() => Effect.succeed("1.0.0"));
```

No `hooks.server.ts` setup is required for that case.

## When to call `ServerRuntime.make(...)`

Call `ServerRuntime.make(...)` when your remote functions need services that are
not provided automatically by the runtime.

Typical examples:

- a database service
- an authenticated upstream API client
- a structured logger
- a configuration layer

The usual place to do that is `src/hooks.server.ts`:

```ts
import { Layer } from "effect";
import { ServerRuntime } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
import { Database } from "$lib/server/database";
import { Logger } from "$lib/server/logger";

export const init = () => {
  ServerRuntime.make(
    Layer.provide(Database.Live),
    Layer.provide(Logger.Live),
  );
};
```

If `ServerRuntime.make(...)` is called again later, the new runtime replaces the
previous one.

## `RequestEvent` is provided automatically

Each remote execution receives the current SvelteKit `RequestEvent` as a
service:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { Query, RequestEvent } from "svelte-effect-runtime";

export const get_session = Query(() =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const event = yield* RequestEvent;

    return {
      user_id: event.cookies.get("user_id"),
      pathname: event.url.pathname,
    };
  })
);
```

This matters because `RequestEvent` is request-scoped, while the server runtime
itself is global. You should not try to bake per-request values into
`ServerRuntime.make(...)`. Put long-lived services in the runtime, and read
request-specific data from `RequestEvent` inside the Effect.

## Global services vs request-scoped values

The server runtime is a good place for long-lived infrastructure:

- pooled database connections
- reusable HTTP clients
- telemetry
- configuration

It is not the right place for data that changes per request:

- cookies
- headers
- route params
- the current user

For request-scoped values, read `RequestEvent` and derive what you need from it
inside the Effect:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { Query, RequestEvent } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
import { UserRepository } from "$lib/server/user-repository";

export const get_current_user = Query(() =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const event = yield* RequestEvent;
    const users = yield* UserRepository;
    const session_id = event.cookies.get("session_id");

    return yield* users.find_by_session(session_id);
  })
);
```

That separation keeps the runtime stable while still giving each invocation
access to the current request.

## Prerender runs through the same server runtime

`Prerender(...)` uses the same server runtime model as `Query(...)`,
`Command(...)`, and `Form(...)`. The difference is when it runs:

- `Query`, `Command`, and `Form` run during request handling.
- `Prerender` runs during prerendering and build-time remote evaluation.

If a prerendered remote function needs custom services, those services still
need to be installed into `ServerRuntime.make(...)`.

## Failure handling

The server runtime does more than just provide services. It is also where remote
Effect failures are interpreted:

- form validation failures become SvelteKit invalid responses
- domain failures are serialized for the client
- defects are surfaced as server errors

That lets you keep remote function bodies as plain Effect programs while the
runtime handles the transport boundary.

## Choosing what belongs in the server runtime

Put something in the server runtime if all of the following are true:

- it is safe to run only on the server
- remote functions need it
- it is stable enough to be shared across executions

Do not put something in the server runtime if it is:

- browser-only
- request-specific
- secret data that should be derived later from the current request rather than
  stored globally
