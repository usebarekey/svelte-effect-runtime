# script effect

`<script effect>` is the opt-in source form for component-local Effect execution.

## Source form

```svelte
<script lang="ts" effect>
  import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

  let count = $state(0);

  const increment = Effect.gen(function* () {
    count += 1;
  });
</script>
```

## Transform semantics

- Declarations remain hoisted at component scope.
- Top-level executable statements are lowered into a mount-time `Effect.gen(...)`.
- `yield*` declarations are preserved through the lowering pass.
- The generated program runs on mount.
- The generated program is canceled on unmount.
- HMR disposal is registered for running programs.
