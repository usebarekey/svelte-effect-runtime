# Server Runtime

Server runtime APIs provide the Effect environment for remote functions.

```ts
import {
  get_server_runtime_or_throw,
  RequestEvent,
  ServerRuntime,
} from "svelte-effect-runtime";
```

## Signatures

```ts
interface ServerRuntimeSeed {
  pipe(): Layer.Layer<never>;
  pipe<const Ops extends readonly [RuntimeOperator, ...Array<RuntimeOperator>]>(
    ...ops: Ops
  ): FinalRuntimeLayer<Ops>;
  make(): void;
  make<const Ops extends readonly [RuntimeOperator, ...Array<RuntimeOperator>]>(
    ...ops: Ops
  ): void;
}
```

```ts
export type RequestEventService = ReturnType<typeof get_native_request_event>;

export const RequestEvent: Context.Tag<
  RequestEventService,
  RequestEventService
>;

export function get_server_runtime_or_throw(): ManagedRuntime.ManagedRuntime<
  unknown,
  unknown
>;
```

## Semantics

- `ServerRuntime.make(...)` constructs the active server runtime immediately.
- `get_server_runtime_or_throw()` returns the active runtime if one has already
  been registered.
- If no runtime has been registered yet, `get_server_runtime_or_throw()` lazily
  creates a default runtime with an empty layer.
- Calling it again replaces the active server runtime.
- `RequestEvent` is provided automatically during remote execution.
- Inside a remote Effect, use `yield* RequestEvent`.

## Default runtime

Calling `ServerRuntime.make()` from `hooks.server.ts` is **optional**. When no
runtime has been registered, the first remote Effect that executes creates a
default runtime automatically. This is sufficient for remote functions that do
not depend on any custom services.

`RequestEvent` is still provided automatically during remote execution. Call
`ServerRuntime.make(...)` only when you need to provide additional `Context`
services or layers:

```ts
// src/hooks.server.ts
import { ServerRuntime } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
import { MyApi } from "$lib/my-api";
import { Layer } from "effect";

export const init = () => {
  ServerRuntime.make(Layer.provide(MyApi.Live));
};
```
