# Client Runtime

Remote functions are defined on the server, but their callable surfaces are used
from the browser. `svelte-effect-runtime` turns those browser-side call sites
into Effect programs, and those programs run through the client runtime.

```ts
import { ClientRuntime } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
```

This page explains what the client runtime is doing, when you need to configure
it, and how it interacts with remote adapters in the browser.

## What the client runtime does

On the client, `svelte-effect-runtime` uses the client runtime to execute
Effect-based browser code, including:

- `<script effect>` blocks
- inline event handlers that use `yield*`
- `{@render ...}` blocks lowered to Effect-backed snippets
- remote function calls that return `Effect`
- `Form.submit(...)` when you use the Effect-returning submit helper

For remote functions specifically, the client runtime powers the browser-side
adapters returned by `Query`, `Command`, `Prerender`, and `Form.submit(...)`.
Those adapters decode remote failures into Effect errors instead of throwing
plain transport exceptions.

## What this means for remote functions

When you import a remote function into a component, the browser-facing callable
surface is not just a `Promise` API. It is an Effect-aware API.

Examples:

- `Query(...)` returns an Effect-returning client callable.
- `Command(...)` returns an Effect-returning client callable with `pending`.
- `Prerender(...)` returns an Effect-returning client callable.
- `Form(...)` preserves the native form surface and also exposes `submit(...)`
  as an Effect.

That lets you compose remote calls with normal Effect operators on the client:

```svelte
<script lang="ts" effect>
  import { Effect } from "effect";
  import { get_post } from "./posts.remote";

  let slug = $state("intro");
  let post = $state<{ title: string } | null>(null);

  post = yield* get_post({ slug });

  const refresh = Effect.gen(function* () {
    post = yield* get_post({ slug });
  });
</script>

<button onclick={yield* refresh}>Refresh</button>
```

The remote function still executes on the server. The client runtime only runs
the browser-side Effect that initiates the call, awaits the response, and
decodes any remote failure into the Effect error channel.

## Default behavior

`ClientRuntime.make(...)` is optional.

If no client runtime has been registered yet, the first Effect-backed client
operation creates a default runtime with an empty layer automatically. That is
enough for:

- `<script effect>` code with no custom services
- remote function calls that do not require browser-provided services
- inline event handlers built from plain Effect operators

This works without `hooks.client.ts`:

```svelte
<script lang="ts" effect>
  import { get_version } from "./version.remote";

  let version = $state("");
  version = yield* get_version();
</script>

<p>{version}</p>
```

## When to call `ClientRuntime.make(...)`

Call `ClientRuntime.make(...)` when the browser-side Effect code around your
remote functions needs custom services.

Typical examples:

- a client logger
- a browser storage service
- a client-side API abstraction
- analytics or telemetry wrappers

The usual place to register those services is `hooks.client.ts`:

```ts
import { Layer } from "effect";
import { ClientRuntime } from "svelte-effect-runtime";
import { BrowserLogger } from "$lib/client/browser-logger";
import { DraftStore } from "$lib/client/draft-store";

export const init = () => {
  ClientRuntime.make(Layer.provide(BrowserLogger.Live), Layer.provide(DraftStore.Live));
};
```

That global client runtime will then be reused by effect components and by the
Effect-backed remote adapters used in the browser.
